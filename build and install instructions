# Setup a new conda virtual environment.
Do not install any packages like pandas or numpy. These dependencies should be recognized by conda during installation of your test package filip_test_package.
    command: conda create -n test_env python=3.8

# Activate environment
    command: conda activate test_env

# Install conda-build and anaconda-client
#   command: conda install anaconda-client conda-build

# Add configs to conda
# Do this only if it has not been done already
#   command: conda config --add channels conda-forge
#   command: conda config --set pip_interop_enabled True





# Build your package
## Things to do before bulindg
Before building make sure that either the script section in the build section is empty or that there is a build.sh file
Make sure that you have a setup.py in your project folder!!!
Make following entry in meta.yaml:
    git_url: https://github.com/GreenfishK/test_repository.git
Only meta.yaml and buil.sh are needed for building. Can also be just those two files in an otherwise empty folder and the source can be sourced from github
Build:
    command: conda-build . --croot ../conda-build



# Install
Trouble shooting:
#1 If you try to install a package that does not exist it will not work. 
#2 After the package has been built and the command "conda install filip_test_package" has been executed from an arbitrary location it will not work.
#3 If you are in the conda-build/noarch directory and execute "conda install filip_test_package" it will not find any such package.
    command: cd <directory where the package was built>/noarch

## Things to check
Mandatory files in info directory: 
* files
* paths.json
* index.json

Check whether your info/files file is not empty. All the paths must be provided there where the package files should be linked
Check whether your info/paths.json file is not empty
More info: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/pkg-specs.html

Inside filip_test_package-0.5.0-py_0.tar.bz2 there should be the same directory structure as it should be distributed to $CONDA_PREFIX (location where conda is installed)
    command: conda install --use-local filip_test_package-0.5.0-py_0.tar.bz2
